## Getting Help

This repository is maintained as an open-source resource for engineers building physical AI systems for oncology clinical trials.

### Questions and Discussions

- **GitHub Issues**: Open an issue for bugs, feature requests, or questions about integration pipelines.
- **Discussions**: Use the GitHub Discussions tab (if enabled) for open-ended questions about framework selection, clinical deployment strategies, or multi-site coordination.

### Before Opening an Issue

1. Run `python scripts/verify_installation.py` to confirm your environment.
2. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/kevinkawchak/physical-ai-oncology-trials/issues) for similar reports.
3. Include your OS, Python version, GPU/CUDA version, and relevant framework versions.
